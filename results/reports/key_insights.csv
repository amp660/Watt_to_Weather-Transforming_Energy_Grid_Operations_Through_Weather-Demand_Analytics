Finding,Description,Evidence
U-Shaped Relationship,Energy demand increases at both temperature extremes (below 40°F and above 80°F),Quadratic regression shows significant temp² coefficient (p < 0.001)
Temperature Impact,Temperature explains 18.6% of demand variation,Correlation analysis and feature importance rankings
Seasonal Variation,Summer demand exceeds winter by 207.4 GWh on average,ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests confirm seasonal differences (p < 0.001)
Regional Differences,ERCO (Texas) shows highest weather sensitivity among major regions,Regional sensitivity analysis and interaction effects
Weather Sensitivity,Humidity and cloud cover have secondary effects on demand,Multiple regression coefficients and partial correlations
Model Performance,Random Forest model achieves R² of 0.997 in demand prediction,Cross-validation results on test dataset
